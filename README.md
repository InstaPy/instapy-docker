## Presentation
This is the docker version of [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy) which is declined in two categories:
  - docker
  - docker-compose

Both version used the same docker image hosted by the Docker Hub registry. We want to propose these two approaches, depending of everyone's preferences.

Tags used by image always refers to the corresponding version of InstaPy. Example: `instapy:0.6.1` is for InstaPy released version `0.6.1`.

The `latest`tag refers to the latest released version of InstaPy

## InstaPy documentation
